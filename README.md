# The Collective Desktop

The Collective Desktop is a single image monthly newsletter from The Design Office, a group of 16+ designers who share a workspace in downtown Providence, R.I.

About the project
One of the reasons we share space is to be exposed to work other than our own. Although conversations occur daily, it's more rare to stand behind someone as they work. This newsletter is a collage of screen captures provided by Design Office members showing something they value on their screen from the past month. The Collective Desktop shows some process, and some inspiration. It's a synthesized version of what each of us is looking at on our separate machines.

We'll send one out at the beginning of each month with the previous month's screenshots.
